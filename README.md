# ENE331_LAB01

## Objective
To implement an embedded system on STM32F411 using **register configuration only** that includes:

- LED blinking every 1.2 ms
- Button input to change state
- Look-Up Table (LUT) LED pattern on PA1–PA3
- Timer2 output 20 µs pulse at PB10
- Independent operation of each function

## Hardware
- STM32F411CEU6 (BlackPill board)
- Tactile pushbutton
- 3x LEDs for PA1–PA3
- 1x LED for PA6
- Oscilloscope for PB10 signal
